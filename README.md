# A Survey of Computational Argumentation Tools
This survey contains the content and code for *Fantastic Argumentation Tools And Where To Find Them*--a continuously ongoing survey of tools and libraries for computational argumentation.

The survey webpage is available at [https://people.cs.umu.se/~tkampik/argtools/](https://people.cs.umu.se/~tkampik/argtools/).

If you would like to add a new tool or library, fork the repository, add a new YAML file to [./tools], and open a pull requests.
You can take one of the existing files as a blueprint.
Alternatively, open an issue with your request.
The same applies to changes to the properties of tools that the survey already covers.
