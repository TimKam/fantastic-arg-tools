Name: ASPforASPIC
Description: >-
  ASPforASPIC is a solver for deciding credulous and skeptical acceptance and
  finding (an arbitrary number of) extensions in ASPIC+, via reductions to
  answer set programming. Supports reasoning without preferences, many semantics
  under last-link principle and stable semantics under weakest-link principle.
