Name: RASPIC
Description: >-
  RASPIC provides efficient algorithms for finding the stability and relevance
  status of literals in (a fragment of) incomplete ASPIC+ frameworks with and
  without preferences. A literal is stable if it is justified (or defeated, etc)
  in every completion of the incomplete framework. A literal q is relevant for
  another literal l if adding q as fact makes l stable.
